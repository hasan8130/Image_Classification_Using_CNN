# Image_Classification_Using_CNN
Dataset: The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat
It was only effectively addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural networks. While the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification
The **Dog Vs Cat** image classification dataset consists of 8005 images belonging to 2 classes for training images and 2023 images belonging to 2 classes for testing images 


1.   Class I = Dog
2.   Class II= Cat

* Prepare the dataset for the model
* Develop convolutional neural network model for classifying the images or Dog Vs cat
* Plot the change in accuracy per epochs
* Evaluate the model on the testing data
* Analyse the model summary
* Add Dropout to prevent overfitting and check its effect on accuracy
* Increasing the number of Hidden Layers check its effect on accuracy
* Manipulate the batch_size and epochs and check its effect on accuracy
